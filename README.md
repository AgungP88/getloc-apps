# DESCRIPTION

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem that tries to find the shortest route for salesmen who want to visit several cities without having to visit the same city more than once.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features. In this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes.
